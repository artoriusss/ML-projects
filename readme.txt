Problem 1: Power iteration method (3 pts)
The aim of this assignment is to implement the power method, a simple iterative algorithm for numerical calculation of the dominant eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenvector of a square matrix A, test its limitations, and verify necessary conditions on A. You will also use the inverse power method, a modification of the regular power method, that finds the remaining non-dominant eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A.

Problem 2: PageRank algorithm  (3 pts)
The main aim of this task is to understand how the PageRank algorithm works, why successive iterations give or sometimes do not give a reasonable solution, and how to modify the original adjacency matrix to get a regular Markov chain with a unique stationary distribution.

Problem 4: Spectral Clustering and MDS (3 pts)
In this task, you will understand what spectral clustering is and, most importantly, why it works.

Instructions:

    This is a team assignment, so please form a group of two; only one submission from team members is necessary.
    You will need to submit the ipynb-notebooks, in which all cells have been executed; please do not forget to rename the files to Name1_Name2_hw2_task*.ipynb
    Short oral defences of your work will be scheduled individually for each team
