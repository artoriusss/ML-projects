Let us model the Internet surfing process of a randomly sampled user, who starts at a random page and at each step follows a random link to another site (chosen with equal probabilities from all available ones)\n","\n","#### Then the probability that a user visits the website $u$ at a step $k$ is calculated as $r_{u, k} = \\sum_{i\\rightarrow u}\\frac{r_{i, k-1}}{l_i}$ where $l_i$ is the number of outgoing links from the page $i$. Or, in  matrix form, $\\mathbf{r}_k = L\\mathbf{r}_{k-1}$, where $L$ is an adjacency matrix of the graph, with each column divided by it's sum; $L_{i, j}$ represents probability of going from the page $i$ to page $j$. We want to determine the equilibrium percentages, where $L\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{r}$\n","\n","#### The equation above can be solved directly, but this is unfeasible for  large matrices. Instead, we can interpret $L$ as a Markov matrix; if it is regular, then subsequent iterations $\\mathbf{r}_k = L\\mathbf{r}_{k-1}$ will converge to the true solution $\\mathbf{r}$\n","\n","#### Note: you will be using the $\\mathtt{networkx}$ library for graph representations and manipulations\n","---\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"pP5srQ-TIAt4"},"source":["## **1.
