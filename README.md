# ML-projects

This repository is a collection of small projects I & my teammates have done to learn and practice machine learning. The notebooks contain both the code and thorough explanations of the conceptual / mathematical foundations of implemented algorithms. The repository is updated regularly as we learn and implement more interesting stuff.
